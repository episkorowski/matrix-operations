# matrix-operations

This is a short program written in C that allows the user to perform matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication 
with two matrices of any dimensions from the command line. The program was originally a class assignment that I later modified
to add some extra functionality. It makes heavy use of pointers and directly accessing memory addresses to read and
write to the matrices as well as perform the operations. The goal of the program is to perform the operations as efficiently as possible.
