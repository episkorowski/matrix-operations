# matrix-operations

This is a short program written in C that allows the user to perform matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication 
with matrices of any dimensions from the command line. The program was originally a class assignment that I later modified
to add some extra functionality. The program makes heavy use of pointers and accessing memory addresses to read and
write to the matrices as well as perform the operations.
